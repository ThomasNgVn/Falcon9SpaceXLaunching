# INTRODUCTION

SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars;
other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because
SpaceX can reuse the first stage.

Therefore if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a
launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX
for a rocket launch

# METHODOLOGIES

- We will predict if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully in order to
determine the cost of the launch.
- We collect data by SpaceX API and scraping from Wikipedia
- Then, we Exploratory data by SQL and Visualization
- We use some machine algorithm to predict the result such as SVM,
Classification Trees and Logistic Regression and K-Nearest Neighbors
